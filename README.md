# MyPortfolio
 Introduction to me and my projects. Click to access [the main page](https://eevaarhipoff.github.io/MyPortfolio/).

 This Portfolio page includes pictures and stories of my projects done in school and at free time.

 The visual look of this page is mainly from a free template. I have modified it to suit my needs. Someday I propably will make my own version of portfolio, but now I'm focused on school projects and try to build up something else to show my skills.
